0 no_label Stress, either physiological, biological or psychological, is an organism's response to a stressor such as an environmental condition.[1] Stress is the body's method of reacting to a condition such as a threat, challenge or physical and psychological barrier. There are two hormones that an individual produces during a stressful situation, these are well known as adrenaline and cortisol.[2] Stimuli that alter an organism's environment are responded to by multiple systems in the body.[3] In humans and most mammals, the autonomic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis are the two major systems that respond to stress.[4]
